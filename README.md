### Used technologies for front-end

For front-end I used [React.js](https://react.com) with wersion *[16.8.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1680-february-6-2019)*, so I was able to use **React Hooks**, which helped me to write the whole app only using of functional components (succeed in 99%).
I tried to write as clean code as it is possible so if it wasn't required, I did't use **if-else** statement.

Front-end **styling** is solved with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

The **unidirectional data flow** is resolved with [React's Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).
Communication with backend is realized with **endpoints**, these communications are resolved around of each bigger componenets, with the help of Context.

### Used technologies for back-end

The back-end uses the **database as a service** arhitecture with the help of Google's [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
